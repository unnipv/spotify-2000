# TDD Maintenance & Progress Tracking

## Living Document Philosophy
The [TDD.md](mdc:TDD.md) file is our **primary source of truth** and must be continuously updated to reflect actual progress, discoveries, bugs, and learnings.

## When to Update TDD.md

### Mandatory Updates
**ALWAYS** update [TDD.md](mdc:TDD.md) when:
- [ ] Completing any feature implementation
- [ ] Discovering bugs or issues
- [ ] Making architectural decisions or changes
- [ ] Learning new Rust concepts that affect the project
- [ ] Performance optimizations or measurements
- [ ] API integration challenges or solutions
- [ ] UI/UX changes or improvements
- [ ] Testing results and findings
- [ ] Deployment or build issues
- [ ] Security considerations or implementations

### Update Triggers
Update [TDD.md](mdc:TDD.md) immediately after:
```rust
// EXPLAIN: "After implementing any significant function, update TDD progress"
pub fn significant_function() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Implementation...
    
    // TODO: Update TDD.md with:
    // - What was implemented
    // - Any challenges faced
    // - Performance observations
    // - Next steps
}
```

## TDD Update Structure

### Progress Tracking Section
Add this section to [TDD.md](mdc:TDD.md) after the conclusion:

# Development Progress & Observations

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
#### Month 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Project setup and development environment âœ… 2024-01-15
- [x] Tauri application scaffold âœ… 2024-01-16
- [ ] Basic Rust backend structure ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] React frontend foundation
- [ ] Spotify OAuth implementation
- [ ] Basic audio playback integration

**Observations & Learnings:**
- Tauri setup was smoother than expected
- Rust ownership concepts challenging but manageable
- Need to focus more on error handling patterns

**Bugs & Issues:**
- None critical at this stage

**Performance Notes:**
- Initial app startup: ~2.3s (target: <2s)
- Memory usage: 45MB baseline (target: <50MB)

#### Month 2: Essential Features
- [ ] Core UI components (transport controls, track display)
- [ ] Spotify Web Playback SDK integration
- [ ] Basic playlist management
- [ ] Settings system
- [ ] Local data storage

#### Month 3: UI Polish and Testing
- [ ] Complete Windows Media Player visual recreation
- [ ] Audio visualization system
- [ ] Theme system implementation
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Architecture Decisions Log

#### 2024-01-15: Framework Selection
**Decision:** Chose Tauri over Electron
**Reasoning:** 
- Smaller bundle size (projected 10-40MB vs 100MB+)
- Better performance with Rust backend
- Native OS integration capabilities
- Security benefits

**Impact:** Requires learning Rust but provides better long-term foundation

#### 2024-01-16: State Management
**Decision:** Zustand for React state management
**Reasoning:**
- Simpler than Redux for this use case
- Better TypeScript integration
- Smaller learning curve for new Rust developer

**Impact:** Cleaner frontend code, easier testing
